Nooblook - a Better Battlelog plugin for Battlefield 4.

Fetches the server's players skill, averages them and compares it to yours and displays it in a visual manner in the serverlist.

NOTE: The color indicator is based on your skill level that is fetched from BF3stats. If the server's skill lvl is over 300 points lower than yours - it show's it as gray, and if it's over 300 points over yours, it shows it as completely red.

The numbers below playernumbers are the average skill level, and the median skill level of the server.

The server has to have players in it, and the playerlist in the right has to be open.

Note that I hold no responsibilities what so ever according to using this plugin to Better Battlelog. Your bans and consequences are your own and I can not be hold responsible for those - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. All data is public and open and doesn't help you in game at all, so I don't see any problem with it.
